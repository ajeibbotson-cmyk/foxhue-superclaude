# Design Inspiration References

Curated list of websites and design patterns for inspiration. Populate during the research phase (Phase 2) before building design directions.

## How to Use

Research 10-12 websites relevant to the client's industry and desired aesthetic. For each reference, fill in:
- URL and site name
- Category (what type of site it is)
- What's effective about the design
- Which design direction (A, B, or C) it might inspire
- What to borrow or adapt for this project

The `/creative-process` command reads this file to generate the client-facing creative process page.
