# Foxhue SuperClaude — Agency Project Template

## Overview
Reusable project template for Foxhue client website builds. New client projects are created using GitHub's "Use this template" feature, then configured via `project.json` and scaffolded with `/scaffold`.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/ajeibbotson-cmyk/foxhue-superclaude
**Usage**: Template repo → "Use this template" → configure `project.json` → run `/scaffold`

## Project Lifecycle

1. Create a new repo from this template
2. Edit `project.json` with client details, brand tokens, pages, design directions, and deliverable flags
3. Run `/scaffold` to generate all infrastructure files
4. Populate `inspiration/references.md` with design research (10-12 sites)
5. Run `/seo-report` for competitor SEO analysis
6. Run `/social-audit` for social media landscape (if enabled)
7. Build 3 design directions in `designs/design-{a,b,c}/`
8. Run `/creative-process` to generate the client-facing creative process page
9. Deploy to GitHub Pages, share hub link with client
10. Client picks favourite direction → build full website in `website/`
11. Build layout variants in `website/variants/` (B and C alternatives)
12. Run `/landing-page {service}` if applicable
13. Client reviews layout preferences via review hub
14. Apply preferences, final polish, deliver

See `docs/workflow-guide.md` for the full 5-phase workflow with timelines.

## Commands

### `/scaffold`
Reads `project.json` and generates all infrastructure files:
- `index.html` — Foxhue Project Hub with 4-card layout (Creative Process, Design Directions, Layout Review, SEO Report) plus conditional cards for social audit and landing page
- `designs/index.html` + `designs/styles.css` — design direction hub
- `website/styles.css` — brand tokens as CSS custom properties
- `website/variants/index.html` — client review hub with AJAX form submission
- `website/variants/thank-you.html` — form confirmation page
- `CLAUDE.md` — project context (overwrites this file with client-specific version)
- `docs/client-asset-brief.md` — asset request checklist
- `docs/project-status.md` — deliverables tracker (adjusts based on `deliverables` flags)

### `/seo-report`
Uses Perplexity MCP to research competitors and generate a branded SEO report:
- Finds 3-5 competitors via Perplexity search
- Deep analysis of each competitor's SEO, content, and local presence
- Gap analysis comparing client to competitors
- Outputs `docs/seo-competitor-report.html`

### `/social-audit`
Uses Perplexity MCP to research the client's social landscape:
- Audits current social presence (from `client.social` URLs)
- Competitor social analysis via Perplexity
- Platform recommendations and content strategy
- Growth roadmap (3-month plan)
- Outputs `docs/social-media-audit.html`

### `/creative-process`
Generates a client-facing creative process page:
- Reads `project.json` + `inspiration/references.md`
- Narrative walkthrough: Brief → Research → Inspiration → Principles → Directions
- Outputs `docs/creative-process.html`
- Run **after** `references.md` is populated and designs are built

### `/landing-page {service}`
Generates a service/campaign landing page with Webflow-embeddable sections:
- User specifies the service: `/landing-page laser hair removal`
- Outputs `landing/index.html` + 14 section blocks in `landing/sections/`
- Each section is self-contained with its own `<style>` block
- BEM naming with `{slug}-` prefix, responsive breakpoints: 1200, 991, 767, 478px

## project.json Schema

| Section | Fields | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `agency` | name, primary_email, cc_email, github_org | Agency details for forms and deployment |
| `client` | name, short_name, tagline, slug, industry, location, phone, email, website | Client identity |
| `client.social` | instagram, facebook, tiktok, linkedin, google_business | Social media profile URLs (for `/social-audit`) |
| `brand.colors` | primary, accent, accent_hover, background, surface | CSS custom properties |
| `brand.fonts` | heading, body, google_fonts_url | Typography |
| `designs[]` | key, name, mood | Design direction definitions |
| `pages[]` | key, title, slug | Website pages to build |
| `deliverables` | seo_report, creative_process, social_audit, landing_page | Feature flags — controls which hub cards and status items are generated |

## Architecture Notes
- All generated files read from `project.json` — no hardcoded client data
- CSS variable prefix uses `client.slug` (e.g., `--marr-primary` for slug "marr")
- Review hub uses AJAX form submission via Formsubmit.co (stays on page)
- Images stored locally in `website/images/`, shared across website, designs, and landing
- All HTML self-contained with Google Fonts loaded via `<link>`
- Website breakpoints: 992px, 767px, 477px
- Landing breakpoints: 1200px, 991px, 767px, 478px
- Deploy to GitHub Pages from `main` branch
- `deliverables` flags control conditional generation in `/scaffold` (hub cards, status items)
