# /social-audit — Generate social media audit and strategy report

Read `project.json` for client context, then use Perplexity MCP to research the client's social landscape and generate a branded report.

## Steps

### 1. Read project.json
Extract:
- `client.name`, `client.industry`, `client.location` — for search context
- `client.slug` — for CSS variable prefixes
- `client.social.*` — existing social profile URLs (instagram, facebook, tiktok, linkedin, google_business)
- `brand.colors.*`, `brand.fonts.*` — for report styling
- `agency.name` — for report attribution

### 2. Audit current social presence via Perplexity

If `client.social` URLs are provided, use `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_search` to assess each active profile:

**For each non-empty social URL**:
- Search: `"{client.name}" site:{platform}.com`
- Assess: posting frequency, content types, engagement levels, follower count (if visible), profile completeness
- Note: last post date, bio quality, link in bio, highlights/pinned content

If no social URLs provided, search for the client's presence:
- `"{client.name}" {client.location} social media`
- Note what platforms they appear on organically

### 3. Competitor social analysis via Perplexity

Use `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_research` to investigate competitor social strategies:

**Search queries** (adapt based on industry):
1. `"best {client.industry} social media accounts {client.location}"`
2. `"{client.industry} businesses {client.location} instagram facebook"`
3. `"successful {client.industry} social media strategy examples"`

**For each competitor found, assess**:
- Which platforms they're active on
- Posting frequency and content types
- Engagement patterns (comments, shares, saves)
- Content themes that perform well
- Visual style and branding consistency
- Use of stories, reels, video content

### 4. Platform analysis via Perplexity

Use `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_search` to get current platform insights:
- `"{client.industry} best social media platforms 2025 2026"`
- `"social media trends {client.industry}"`

Determine which platforms matter most for this industry and location.
